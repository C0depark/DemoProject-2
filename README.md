# Demo Project 2

For this project I set up a docker container that automatically loads all of the dependencies and serves the application over the local network. The application itself is not very involved however, and consists of retrieving data from an external API to display on the front-end.

## Running the Application

Run the following command in the terminal
```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/
